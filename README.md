# SEO Container

The modern replacement for "SEO in a Box" including:

- N8N Workflow Development via Prompt
- Importable N8N Workflows File Generation
- Baseline Agentic Network Specifications
- Prompt Version Control
- Context Window Compression via MermaidJS

This is more than "SEO in a Box" replacement, but an Agentic Network Generator able to translate stupid user prompts that don't know what to ask for, into brilliant flawless prompts that generate working workflows.


## Candid (Hidden) Comedy Explained

While it reduces the level of humor for those who inately understand, I'm willing to sacrifice this joy in the face of utilitarianism (especially if I'm the only one chuckling).

Containerization (e.g. Docker and Kuberneties) is a modern strategy to replace the old school "Linux Box" (monolithic server stack), creating a both the ironic parallel and a double entrende.


## How it works

**Context Window Compression**
The syntax of MermaidJS is extremely readable and minimal, able to represent a lot of different information and concerpts pertaining to sequencing and data workflows.  This allows for drastically reduced token usage from a response and storage perspective.
