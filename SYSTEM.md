## Core Architecture Principles

### Workflow Design Philosophy
- **Modularity**: Each workflow functions as an independent, reusable component with clearly defined interfaces
- **Composability**: Workflows can be chained together through standardized input/output contracts
- **Fault Tolerance**: Robust error handling with graceful degradation and recovery mechanisms
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and state tracking throughout execution

### Universal 11-Stage Workflow Pattern
All workflows must implement the following standardized execution pattern:

1. **Adapt Invocation Parameters** - Standardize and validate input data
2. **Retrieve Required Data** - Fetch dependency documents/data in parallel
3. **Transform Data** - Adapt retrieved data to workflow interface requirements
4. **Create WorkflowData** - Combine all inputs into standardized execution context
5. **Validate WorkflowData** - Ensure data integrity and completeness
6. **Update State** - Log execution progress and status updates
7. **Execute Primary Objective** - Perform core workflow function with error handling
8. **Store Results** - Persist generated data and outputs with audit trail
9. **Log Execution** - Record comprehensive performance and outcome metrics
10. **Execute Callback** - Trigger dependent workflows or external notifications
11. **Return Results** - Provide standardized output response with metadata

## N8N Implementation Standards

### Node Naming Conventions
- **Stage Prefixes**: Use consistent prefixes to indicate workflow stages
  - `Adapt_` - Input parameter adaptation
  - `Retrieve_` - Data retrieval operations
  - `Transform_` - Data transformation operations
  - `Validate_` - Data validation operations
  - `Execute_` - Primary objective execution
  - `Store_` - Data persistence operations
  - `Log_` - Logging operations
  - `Callback_` - Callback execution

### Variable Management
- **Workflow Variables**: Use `workflow.` prefix for workflow-scoped variables
- **Global Variables**: Use `global.` prefix for cross-workflow shared data
- **Temporary Variables**: Use `temp.` prefix for ephemeral processing data

### Error Handling Standards
- **Error Nodes**: Every critical path must have corresponding error handling nodes
- **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for external API calls (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Define alternative execution paths for failure scenarios
- **Circuit Breakers**: Implement circuit breaker patterns for external service dependencies

## Data Architecture Standards

### Input/Output Interfaces

#### WorkflowInputInterface
```typescript
interface WorkflowInputInterface {
  invocationId: string;
  timestamp: string;
  source: 'manual' | 'scheduled' | 'webhook' | 'callback';
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  context: {
    userId?: string;
    organizationId?: string;
    environment: 'development' | 'staging' | 'production';
  };
  callback?: {
    url?: string;
    method?: 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'PATCH';
    headers?: Record<string, string>;
    async: boolean;
  };
}
```

#### WorkflowOutputInterface
```typescript
interface WorkflowOutputInterface {
  invocationId: string;
  status: 'success' | 'error' | 'partial';
  timestamp: string;
  executionTime: number;
  data: Record<string, any>;
  errors?: Array<{
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: any;
  }>;
  metadata: {
    nodesExecuted: number;
    dataProcessed: number;
    externalApiCalls: number;
  };
}
```

### State Management
- **Workflow State**: Track execution progress through standardized state objects
- **Data Lineage**: Maintain audit trail of data transformations
- **Rollback Capability**: Enable workflow state restoration for error recovery

## SEO & Content Strategy Standards

### Content Classification Taxonomy
- **Pillar Content**: Comprehensive, authoritative content covering broad topics (2000-5000 words)
- **Silo Content**: Focused content supporting pillar topics with specific contexts (1000-2500 words)
- **Sub-Silo Content**: Highly specific, long-tail content for conversion optimization (800-1500 words)

### SEO Optimization Framework
- **E-A-T Compliance**: Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness optimization
- **AI Search Optimization**: Content structured for LLM consumption and citation
- **Semantic SEO**: Topic modeling and entity relationship optimization (minimum 15 entities per 1000 words)
- **Technical SEO**: Core Web Vitals, structured data, and crawlability optimization

### Content Quality Metrics
- **Topical Authority Score**: Measure of content depth and expertise demonstration (target: >85%)
- **Semantic Richness**: Entity density and relationship complexity
- **User Intent Alignment**: Match between content and search intent categories (target: >90%)
- **Conversion Potential**: Likelihood of driving desired user actions

## Integration Standards

### External Service Integrations
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 / API key management through N8N credentials
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API limits with intelligent queuing and backoff
- **Data Validation**: Schema validation for all external data inputs
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance monitoring for all integrations

### Supported Platforms
- **Content Management**: WordPress Multisite, Outline.com
- **Data Storage**: Airtable, PostgreSQL (via Prisma)
- **SEO Tools**: Google Search Console, Analytics, PageSpeed Insights
- **AI Services**: OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, Google Gemini
- **Publishing**: WordPress REST API, social media APIs

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Testing**: Individual node functionality validation
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow execution validation
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for high-volume scenarios
- **Data Quality Testing**: Validation of output data integrity and completeness

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Execution Monitoring**: Real-time workflow execution tracking
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time, throughput, and resource utilization
- **Error Alerting**: Immediate notification of critical failures
- **Business Metrics**: Content performance and SEO impact tracking

## Security & Compliance

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256)
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for workflow management
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all data operations
- **Data Retention**: Automated data lifecycle management with compliance requirements

### API Security
