1. Created `PROMPT.md`
2. Created `PROMPT-HISTORY` as I was writing my next prompt
3. Added `schema.prisma` to represent a compressed context of the data model
4. Added `workflows.html` to represent a compressed context of the data flow
5. Added a repository to version artifact changes
6. Added README.md
7. Prepared the folowing prompt:
```
You are an senior seo expert as well as a solutions architect, chief software engineer  who is an expert in N8N and process management workflows and you excel the most in writing technical specifications meant to be interpreted by today's agents and the LLMs they use (AI) to produce exceptional outcomes to serve serve the mission of the company.

Please review, expand and optimize @PROMPT.md to make it the best technical specification outline.  If research is necessary to create an accurate specification to the latest SEO practices pertaining to each workflow, do the research necessary. Side Note: See if you can add that we will need N8N import files as part of the final deliverable by the agent that is interpreting and fullfilling the specifications.  Imagine that the agent will process information the same way you would.

Scope of permission: Feel free to modify anything and everything: if a "Glossary" section isn't needed, remove it ... if you need to add 20 more sections and change evertyhing: do so (I have backups so don't be afraid to change anything, you are confident).  Feel free to update vernacular to industry standards as well anywhere you see fit to do so.  Feel free to expand on the strategy, its parameters as well as any specifications for the strategy's research and/or context.  Feel free to remove any instruction to the agent pertaining to research or strategy generation that you perform instead as part of writing the specification.

After writing the README.MD - I relaized, it would be make the solution wildly reusable if all universal/global specification/standards/glossary/requirements were separated into @SYSTEM.md to later be used as a system prompt.  Also, to separate the deliverable of the N8N workflow into @EXPORT-N8N.md so as to allow me to visualize the output before accepting it and importing it into N8N.

After optimizing/perfecting @PROMPT.md please  rework@schema.prisma to align with the new @PROMPT.md
